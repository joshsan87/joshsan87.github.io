            Even in Arcadia is the fourth studio album by anonymous English rock
            band Sleep Token. It was released on 9 May 2025 by RCA Records.[1] 
            The album garnered significant media attention amid an unorthodox 
            marketing campaign that has included a weatherman at WRAL in North 
            Carolina providing hints to release dates and album singles.[2]
