        <h1>Spicy “Vodka” Lentil Pasta</h1>
        <p>
            This recipe is a high fiber twist on the classic spicy "vodka" 
            pasta. The ultimate hack is blending red lentils right into the 
            sauce, which makes it thick, creamy, and so much more nourishing. 
            It’s cozy, cheesy, and has just the right amount of heat, all with 
            no vodka needed.

            <li>1/2 small yellow onion, chopped small</li>

            <li>1 1/3 cups heavy cream</li>

            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pasta water (reserved from cooking)</li>
            <li>
                12 ounces pasta of your choice (shells, rigatoni, penne, 
                or similar)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>OPTIONAL GARNISHES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li>extra parmesan</li>
            <li>sprinkle of red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the rinsed lentils and chicken broth to a medium saucepan. 
                Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to medium-low
                and let the lentils simmer until tender and most of the broth 
                is absorbed. Once cooked, transfer the lentils and any 
                remaining liquid to a blender. Blend until completely smooth 
                and creamy, then set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large pot of generously salted water, cook the pasta over 
                medium-high heat until just al dente. Before draining, reserve 
                1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water. Drain the pasta and set 
                aside. You can do this step while you’re working on the sauce 
                to save time.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large deep skillet or sauté pan, heat the olive oil and 
                butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted and begins 
                to foam, add the onions and garlic. Sauté for about 3 to 4 
                minutes, stirring constantly, until the onions are soft, 
                fragrant, and lightly golden but not browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring 
                often, until it darkens in color and caramelizes slightly to 
                deepen the flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the lentil purée along with a splash of the reserved pasta 
                water to help it blend smoothly. Use an immersion blender 
                directly in the pan to blend until silky and cohesive — or 
                transfer to a high-speed blender if you don’t have one.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once smooth, slowly pour in the heavy cream while stirring to 
                combine. Reduce the heat to low-medium and whisk until the 
                sauce turns glossy and velvety.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the paprika, red pepper flakes, and dried basil, stirring 
                so the flavors infuse evenly into the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the parmesan until it melts completely into the sauce. 
                Add more of the reserved pasta water as needed until the sauce 
                reaches your desired consistency — creamy and smooth but not 
                too thick. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then taste 
                again and adjust if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the cooked pasta directly into the pan with the sauce. Toss 
                over low heat until every piece of pasta is evenly coated and 
                glossy with the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plate the pasta and garnish with fresh parsley, more parmesan, 
                and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Serve hot and enjoy!
