            If you want something that tastes like straight chocolate bliss,
            these mousse cups are it. They’re creamy, velvety, and so satisfying
            without ever feeling heavy. I love how effortless they are while 
            still feeling like a restaurant-level dessert.

            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 box (3.4 oz) instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups cold milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 to 3 tablespoons matcha powder, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>CRUST</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups Nilla Wafer crumbs</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons (¾ stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a bowl, whisk together the instant vanilla pudding mix, 
                matcha powder, and cold milk. Let it sit for 10 minutes to 
                thicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once thickened, add in the sweetened condensed milk and softened
                cream cheese. Whisk until completely smooth and creamy. 
                Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream with vanilla extract 
                until stiff peaks form—don’t overmix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold the whipped cream gently into the matcha pudding mixture 
                using a rubber spatula. Chill in the fridge while prepping the 
                rest.
            </li>
            <li>
                In another bowl, combine wafer crumbs with melted butter to 
                create a crust consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                In your serving dish (individual cups, a 9x13 pan or a large 
                trifle dish), begin layering: Start with the crust, then: add 
                banana slices, a layer of whole Nilla wafers, and followed with 
                a thick layer of matcha pudding. Then repeat with another round
                of bananas, wafers, and pudding.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours to allow the wafers 
                to soften and flavors to develop.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before serving, garnish each portion with a banana slice, a 
                whole Nilla Wafer, and a sprinkle of crushed wafers.
