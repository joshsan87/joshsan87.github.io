                pour the chocolate mix over, and use a rubber spatula to fold 
                gently until everything is evenly coated.

                Divide the mixture evenly between two pieces of plastic wrap. 
                Shape each portion into a log, then roll tightly to seal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Unwrap, dust the logs 
                generously with powdered sugar, then slice and serve.
